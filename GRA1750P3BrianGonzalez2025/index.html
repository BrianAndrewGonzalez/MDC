    <h2>Cuban Picadillo Enpanada</h2>
    <p>A Cuban picadillo empanada is a savory pastry filled with picadillo, a traditional Cuban ground beef mixture. The filling usually includes seasoned ground beef, tomato sauce, onions, garlic, green olives, and sometimes raisins or potatoes for a sweet-savory twist. The mixture is wrapped in empanada dough and then baked or fried until golden and crispy. Its a popular snack or appetizer in Cuban cuisine, known for its rich flavor and satisfying texture.</p>
